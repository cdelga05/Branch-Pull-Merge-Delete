This is an action adventure with a focus on endurance. 
The story is about a wily hacker who is mysteriously connected to an ambitious lawman. 
It starts in a tourist town. 
The story ends with a funeral.
But life isn't all sad.
It's all about the journey.
The far we've come and the far we plan to go.
The friends we've made along the way.
The truth is it's all the little things in life that matter.
Happiness comes from within one's own self.
